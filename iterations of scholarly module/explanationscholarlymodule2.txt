The file scholarlymodule2.py is an official breakthrough I've made with the multiple iterations of the scholarly module, unsuccessful attempts with SerpAPI (whose free plan is the 
ultimate reason I couldn't make breakthroughs), and an overall struggle to fight against scholarly's underresourced documentation that made it harder for me to understand where to go.
Thankfully, these breakthroughs were possible... and I'd like to use this file to explain how "scholarlymodule2.py" differs, successfully, from "testedscholarlymodule1.py":

1) The proxy is initialized directly within the main script without specific timeout and wait time values in scholarlymodule2.py
2) It seems so counterintuitive that trying to "capture" or "handle" the MaxTriesExceededException error does NOT work. The new code does not explicitly handle MaxTriesExceededException. 
It focuses on trying to fetch the search results within a single proxy session.
3) The new code uses a check_name_match function to ensure the author's name matches and checks if the publication year is exactly the given year. The check_name_match 
function provides a more flexible way to match author names, which might result in more accurate filtering of relevant papers.
